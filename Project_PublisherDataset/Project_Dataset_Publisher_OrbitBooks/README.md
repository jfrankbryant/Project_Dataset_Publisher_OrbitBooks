# Exploration of Orbit Books, Published between 2007 and 2018
## by J Frank Bryant


## Dataset

This Orbit Books dataset was collected using Internet Speculative Fiction Database's (ISFDB) API and augmented with author identity traits and approximate word counts by me.

I'm quite interested in current state of inclusivity of marginalized communities in the publishing industry. Orbit Books is a publisher of science fiction and fantasy literature that started in 2007. Biographical information for the authors was collected from Wikipedia, author websites, on several occasions the website FantasticFiction.com, and on a few occasions from Twitter bios for the author. Skin color was gathered using Google Images, Twitter, and author websites. Since this information was gathered to determine the inclusivity of Orbit Books, not to out anyone (though as mentioned above all of the information I gathered was publicly available in December 2018) or make it seem like the public has a right to identity information (we don't, authors deserve to not be in the public eye if they don't want to be), I'm not making the augmented publisher dataset with the author identity information public. The dataset in the repo is the cleaned version of the publisher dataset gathered from ISFDB.

Notes about the book format abbreviations:
hc is hardcover
tp is a trade paperback
pb is a mass market paperback
ebook is an ebook (file type not specified)

There currently are no audiobooks listed in this dataset. That will need to be changed eventually to look at what kind of so-called "disability tax" people who are unable to read via text printed on a page are subjected to to enjoy the same books sighted people get to.

The dataset was augmented to include an approximate word count so that estimations about the length of titles could be used in calculations, even for ebooks.
